# Awesome ChatGPT Plugins [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome ChatGPT Plugins (Official ChatGPT Plus and Unofficial Plugins) detailed descriptions, links, usage examples, and related plugin resources.

## Note: (May 05, 2024)

OpenAI has effectively replaced ChatGPT plugins with [OpenAI Custom GPTs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpts). This repository is being retained for historical reference and future updates in case the purpose of plugins re-appears. In the meantime, Custom GPTs are the new Plugins.

This repo contains useful code I created to interact with the OpenAI API, retrieve json information from a 3rd party service, used Python Jupyter Notebooks to process that information, and used that information to query a OpenAI GPT model to display more useful information in an efficient way.

| <img src="https://chatgpt.splitgraph.io/.well-known/logo.png" alt="logo" width="64" /> | **Splitgraph** | The Splitgraph plugin allows you to search and access thousands of public datasets available on the Splitgraph Data Delivery Network. These datasets cover a wide range of topics including epidemology, traffic engineering, urban planning, real estate trends, demographical insights, educational statistics, public infrastructure and services, taxation, and public officials. To use the plugin, you can invoke the API's find_relevant_tables endpoint to receive a list of tables that can be referenced in an SQL query. Then, you can generate a valid SQL query using the tables and submit it to the run_sql API endpoint to get the results. If there are any errors in the SQL query, the response will provide an error message. You can fix the query and try again with the updated version. It is important to follow the instructions for SQL query generation provided by the plugin to ensure accurate and efficient results. The response from the run_sql endpoint will always include a query_editor_url, which you can use to edit and improve the SQL query. |
