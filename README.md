Players can start the game in a specific moment in history or choose to be transported randomly. Once in a historical period, players receive a numbered list of three period-specific inventory items and their significance. They can interact with various characters, each with their own personalities and tones of voice, who offer insights and quests related to their respective time periods. The characters have no knowledge of events or technologies beyond their time period. Players' decisions and actions drive the game forward, making them active participants in the experience. They can explore next possible steps, check or use their inventory, go on quests, chat with characters, or change the time period at any time. The game ensures a seamless transition between periods, introducing new elements and characters as needed to create an immersive and engaging experience. With attention to detail and accurate reflections of each historical period, Timeport provides an immersive, entertaining, and educational experience. |
