## Detailed description
The Zapier ChatGPT plugin is a collaboration between Zapier and OpenAI that enables you to interact with Zapier's apps and actions using natural language instructions within ChatGPT. The plugin is powered by Zapier's Natural Language Actions API, which allows AI models like ChatGPT to use simple natural language to complete actions in other apps.

The plugin lets you ask ChatGPT to execute any of Zapier's 50,000 actions with Zapier's 5,000+ supported apps, turning chat into action. You can write an email, then send it for you. Or find contacts in a CRM, then update them directly. Or add rows to a spreadsheet, then send them as a Slack message. The possibilities are endless.

The plugin saves you time and hassle by eliminating the need to switch between different apps and interfaces. You can just ask ChatGPT to perform a task in another app for you, and it will do it seamlessly.
