## Description

Create notebooks in Python, SQL, and Markdown to explore data, visualize, and share notebooks with everyone.

## Detailed Description

The Noteable plugin is a tool that allows you to interact with Noteable, a platform for creating, running, and sharing Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are a popular tool in data science and machine learning for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. 

1. **Project and Space Management**: You can get and set your default project or space, create new projects, and get a list of files in a project. A project in Noteable is a collection of notebooks and data files, while a space is a collection of projects.

2. **Notebook Management**: You can create new notebooks, get a summary of a notebook (including the list of cell IDs, the current kernel state, and the notebook's name), and get the databases for a notebook.

3. **Cell Management**: You can execute multiple cells in a notebook, create or update cells, change the type of a cell (between code, markdown, and SQL cells), and run a specific cell within a notebook.

4. **Kernel Management**: You can get a list of your active kernel sessions and shut down the kernel for a notebook.

5. **User Information**: You can get details of your Noteable account information, which can be useful when debugging permissions issues.

## Usage

1. **Natural Language Processing:** Simply describe what you want to do, and the techniques you want to use, and you’ll receive an entire notebook as a result.

2. **Data Exploration:** Use ChatGPT to quickly and easily query your data, perform data transformations, and identify patterns or trends.

3. **Collaboration:** Share your insights and discoveries with your team in real-time, fostering a more productive and efficient workflow.
