Speak is a plugin that helps users with language learning by providing translations, explanations of foreign language phrases, and guidance on how to accomplish tasks in a foreign language.

## Detailed description
The Speak ChatGPT plugin was developed in collaboration with Speak, an AI-powered language tutor, and OpenAI. It is a tool that allows ChatGPT users to directly access a version of Speak's language tutoring experience through ChatGPT.

The plugin enables ChatGPT to use Speak's APIs when a user asks a question about another language, like how to say something specific, how to do something, what a particular foreign word or phrase means, or a concept/nuance specific to a foreign language or culture. The plugin can also be activated when the user asks for a language tutor or foreign language conversational partner.

The plugin can translate and explain how to say a specific phrase or word in another language using the `translate` API, explain the meaning and usage of a specific foreign language phrase using the `explainPhrase` API, and explain the best way to say or do something in a specific situation or context with a foreign language using the `explainTask` API. The plugin can also understand the tone, situation, familiarity, usage notes, or any other context from the user's question and provide a tailored response accordingly.

The plugin supports multiple languages and can help users learn new languages with ease and fun.

## Usage
- Use the Speak plugin when you want to learn how to say something specific in another language. For example: "How do I say 'do you know what time it is?' politely in German?"
- Use the Speak plugin when you want to understand the meaning and usage of a foreign language phrase. For example: "What does 'putain' mean in French?"
- Use the Speak plugin when you want to know how to accomplish a task in a foreign language. For example: "How should I politely greet shop employees when I enter, in French?"
- Use the Speak plugin when you want to practice your foreign language skills with a conversational partner. For example: "Can you chat with me in Spanish for 10 minutes?"
- Use the Speak plugin when you want to learn more about a foreign language or culture. For example: "What are some common idioms in Italian?"

## Additional information
