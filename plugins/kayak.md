## Detailed description
The Kayak ChatGPT plugin is an integration between the travel search engine Kayak and ChatGPT, the AI-powered language model developed by OpenAI. The plugin enables users to access Kayak's search engine directly within ChatGPT and ask questions in the same way they would ask a human.

The plugin can search for flights, hotels, and rental cars based on the user's travel dates and destination or get recommendations on where to go based on the user's budget. The plugin can also understand the user's preferences and needs and provide tailored suggestions accordingly.

The plugin makes travel planning easier and more fun by allowing users to interact with Kayak's search engine in a more conversational and intuitive way.

## Usage
- Use the Kayak ChatGPT plugin when you want to search for flights to a specific destination. For example: "Find me the cheapest flight from New York to London in June."
- Use the Kayak ChatGPT plugin when you want to search for hotels in a specific location. For example: "Show me some hotels near Times Square that have free wifi and breakfast."
- Use the Kayak ChatGPT plugin when you want to search for rental cars in a specific city. For example: "I need a car in Los Angeles for a week. What are my options?"
- Use the Kayak ChatGPT plugin when you want to get recommendations on where to travel based on your budget. For example: "I have $1000 to spend on a vacation. Where can I go?"
- Use the Kayak ChatGPT plugin when you want to compare prices or deals across different travel options. For example: "Which is cheaper: flying to Paris or taking the train?"
