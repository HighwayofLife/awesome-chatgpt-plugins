## Detailed description

The ChatGPT WebPilot plugin is a tool that automatically analyzes the web page you are visiting and provides useful information and insights based on your queries. The plugin leverages the power of ChatGPT, a large language model that can generate human-like text for various tasks. The plugin offers the following key features:

- Web Page Summarization: Input a URL, and WebPilot will provide a concise summary of the page’s content, along with three thought-provoking questions or insights—perfect for editors and content creators.
- Intelligent Q&A: Ask questions about the web page you’re visiting, and WebPilot will provide answers based on the page’s content.
- Customized Tone: Specify your desired tone, such as “Steve Jobs,” and WebPilot will respond in that style.
- Language Preference: WebPilot prioritizes your language choice. Start with “Bonjour,” and the conversation continues in French.

- The plugin will then analyze the web page and provide a response based on the query type. For example: `Webpilot Summary: Webpilot is a free and open-source “Copilot for the web”. Unlike ChatGPT, there’s no need to chat or switch pages, and you don’t have to copy and paste. Just select the text and everything else is done automatically.
