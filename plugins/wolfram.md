# Wolfram Plugin

The ChatGPT Wolfram plugin is an enhancement to the ChatGPT AI model that connects it to the Wolfram|Alpha computational engine and Wolfram Language. This integration provides ChatGPT with the ability to perform computations, data analysis, and even generate original content in response to user queries.

## Detailed Description
The plugin was developed in response to the fact that ChatGPT, while remarkably adept at generating human-like text based on what it's learned from the internet, can't perform nontrivial computations or generate consistently accurate data. With the Wolfram plugin, ChatGPT can access the computational capabilities of Wolfram|Alpha and the Wolfram Language, allowing it to perform complex computations, produce accurate data, and even create custom visualizations. The plugin serves as a sort of "brain implant" for ChatGPT, enabling it to query the Wolfram system as needed and weave the responses back into its output.

ChatGPT formulates queries for Wolfram|Alpha, sends them for computation, and then decides what to say based on the results. The plugin also has the ability to deliver accurate, curated knowledge and data, as well as correct, nontrivial computations, and can access up-to-the-minute data, which is a significant enhancement over ChatGPT's usual reliance on its pre-training dataset.

There are two entry points to the Wolfram plugin: a Wolfram|Alpha one that accepts natural language queries, and a more powerful Wolfram Language one that accepts precise Wolfram Language code. ChatGPT has been taught when to reach out to the Wolfram plugin and can switch between the two entry points as needed.

## Usage
- Ask ChatGPT a "world knowledge" question, like "How much beef is produced in different countries?", and it will use the Wolfram plugin to fetch the data.
- Ask ChatGPT to generate a map based on certain data, like the aforementioned beef production.
- Ask ChatGPT to modify the map in some way, such as changing the map projection or transforming the map into a heat map.
- Ask ChatGPT to generate Wolfram Language code based on a certain computational task.
- Instruct ChatGPT to "Use Wolfram" when you want to make use of the Wolfram plugin for a specific task, such as interpreting a DNA sequence.

## Additional Information
The Wolfram plugin can also generate "truly original" content, like computations that have never been done before, and provides custom-created visualizations to ChatGPT.

## Limitations
While the Wolfram plugin greatly enhances ChatGPT's capabilities, there are still limitations. ChatGPT sometimes doesn't know when the Wolfram plugin can help, and might require explicit instruction from the user to utilize it. Furthermore, while the plugin can accept both natural language and Wolfram Language code, the latter requires exact precision and may need multiple iterations to get right.
